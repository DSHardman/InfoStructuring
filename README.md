This code accompanies our recent paper on information structuring for multimodal sensing.

# Figures 2-4
The folder _MembraneTests/_ contains the data and its processing used to create Figures 2, 3 & 4.

Figure 2's main file is _Simulations.m_, Figure 3's main file is _fingerprintPlotting.m_, and Figure 4's main files are _Localization/compareRankings.m_ and _FTestTransfer.m_. Data is loaded automatically when each script is run.

# Figure 5
The CAD files required to cast the sensorized hand are given in the folder _HandCAD/_. A full description of the fabrication process is given in the paper's supplementary material.

# Figure 6
The folder _HandTests/_ contains the data and its processing used to create Figure 6's tactile localization. Its main file is _tactileLocalization.m_
